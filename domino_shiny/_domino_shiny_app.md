For domino to host a shiny app it needs to have an app.sh file in the project directory.
The file does not seem to require any customization on a per-project or per-server level.  I have successfully used the file app.sh in this gist to deploy shiny apps on domino servers

To add this file to your domino project directory, clone this gist and upload the file.  It might be possible to load the file directly from git but I haven't figured out how to do it.
