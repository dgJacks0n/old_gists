Need to sub-classify breast into luminal (~ TNBC) vs other using PAM50 (mRNA) based classification.

Data should be available via TCGAbiolinks (bioconductor package).  Code in tcga_sample_query_example.R retrieves PAM50 types along with ER, PR and HER2 status for TCGA Breast tumors.  PAM50 subtype is only defined for 522 samples - those from Nature 2012 publication?
