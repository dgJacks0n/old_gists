## Issue
For sample annotations in clinical projects a codebook is critical.  Making it is a pain, especially collecting all the columns and info.  In the past I've exported column names to Excel and used other kludges.

## Solution
The script makeCodebook.R simplifies the process of making a codebook.  It starts with your original data frame (e.g. sample attributes), which is loaded from a R data structure (.Rds) file. The column names, types and levels are read automatically; any column-level attributes (length == ncol()) are also included.   It also launches an interactive editor using R's `edit` function to collect column descriptions and notes.  These go into a column named 'labelDescription' to conform to a BioConductor Annotated Data Frame.  The results are saved to a tab-delimited text file.

As a side benefit, it creates some default structure for the codebook.
